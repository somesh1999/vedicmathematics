                     <p> VEDIC MATHEMATICS is completely based on ALGEBRA. It is rediscovered by the greatest mathematician and the Shankaracharya Jagadguru Bharatikrishna Tirthaji Maharaj of Govardhan math puri; Odisha. He is the 143rd Shankaracharya of Govardhan math. Vedic mathematics and binary number is the greatest gift of Govardhan math to the society of Science and mathematics by Jagadguru Bharatikrishna Tirthaji maharaj.
   He was born on 14th march of 1884 in a small village named “Tirunelveli” of Tamil Nadu; his child hood name was Venketraman.  At the age of twenty years he completed his post graduation in six different subjects like Mathematics, Science, History, Philosophy, English and Sanskrit from the Bombay centre of American college of Science Rochester; New York. He was a greatest orator of Sanskrit and awarded the title of “SARASWATI” for his all round proficiency in Sanskrit by the Sanskrit association of Madras.

                    <p style="margin-top:15px;">In 1902 he won the highest place in the graduation B.A. examination.
                    <p> He was a gifted child of his parents, father P. Narasimha Shastri.</p>
                    <p>In 1908 he proceeded to Sringeri Math in Mysore to lay himself at the feet of Jagadguru Shankaracharya Maharaj Shri Satchidananda Shivabhinava Nrisimha Bharati Swami, there he was offered the post of the first Principal of the newly started National college at Rajmahendri.  At the age of twenty seven (27) years he studied advanced Vedanta philosophy for eight years from 1911 to 1919 and practised Brahma-Sadhana at the feed of Shri Nrisimha Bharati swami.</p>
                    <p>In 1919 he was initiated into the holy order of Sannyasa at Varanasi by H.H. Jagadguru Shankaracharya Shri Trivikrama Tirthaji Maharaja of Sharadapeetha and was given the new name, Swami Bharati Krishna tirtha. Three years later in 1921 he was throned as the Shankaracharya of Sharada peetha. In 1925 he shifted to Puri when he was installed as Jagadguru Shankaracharya of the Govardhan math. In 1953 he founded an institution named “SHRI VISHWA PUNARNIRMANA SANGHA”  (World Reconstruction Association) in Nagpur, with Shri Chimanlal Ttrivedi as the general secretary.</p> 
                    <p>It was during his deep meditation retreats between the year 1911 to 1919 in the Shringeri forest he became aware of the sixteen sutras (Word formula) later he associated them with algebra and as those word formulae were found from vedic literature so named them vedic mathematics.</p> 
                    <p>Bharati Krishna Tirthaji attained Mahasamadhi On 2nd February 1960 and five years after his book Vedic mathematics was published by Motilal Banarashidas.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top:15px;"><b>IMPORTANCE OF VEDIC MATHEMATICS:-</b></p>
                    <p>Vedic mathematics is completely based on Algebra (Bija Ganita). All the Vedic mathematical formulae are based on the algebraic formulae. Vedic mathematics makes the calculations interesting, short and very fast even faster than the calculator. Vedic mathematics covers all most all chapters of the school syllabus and college syllabus. The vedic formulae make the calculation ten times faster so, it helps to save the time in solving the simple as well as complex problems.</p>  
                    
                </p>

                <p style="margin-top:15px;"><b>BENEFITS OF VEDIC MATHEMATICS:- </b></p>
                    <p>Vedic mathematics makes the calculation interesting and faster than calculator even ten to fifteen times faster than the normal process of calculation so, a student can save time and paper. The saved time can be devoted in other subjects so that the competition becomes easier. It is very much helpful in Astronomy, Astrology and Kalpa.</p> 
                    <p> Students looking forward to clear CAT, bank PO, NDA, CDS, IIT, JEE, CET, SAT or any other such competitive exams will be greatly benefited by this Vedic mathematics.Interesting tricks eradicates fear of mathematics.</p> 
                    <p style="margin-top:15px;"><b>FUTURE OF VEDIC MATHEMATICS:-</b></p>
                    <p>As Vedic mathematics covers a range of topics from Arithmetic, Algebra, Trigonometry, Geometry and Calculus it is helpful to all class of students and teachers.</p> 
                    <p>  It has application in the field of IT also.
                    Vedic mathematics presently is being practised in the curriculum of South Africa, Oman, UAE, Ghana,   Nigeria, Singapore and Thailand. So, it has a great scope in India and other countries also.</p> 
                    <p style="margin-top:15px;"><b>BENEFITES FOR THE STUDENTS OR TEACHERS OR INSTITUTIONS:-</b></p>
                      
                     <p>1. It helps solving mathematics 10 – 15 times faster. </p>
                     <p>2. It creates interest toward mathematics. </p>
                     <p>3. It will be beneficial throughout life time. </p>
                     <p>4. It helps in intelligent guessing (Knowing the answer without actually solving the problem). </p>
                     <p>5. It is a magical tool to reduce scratch work and finger counting and improve mental calculations. </p>
                     <p>6. It improves concentration. </p>
                     <p>7. It improves confidence. </p>
                     <p>8. Saves times during Examinations. </p>
                     <p>9. Assures a zero error technique. </p>

                     <p style="margin-top:15px;"><b>CLASS ROOM CARRICULUM:- </b></p>
                    <p>It covers Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Square, Square root, Cube, Cube root, Factorisation, H.C.F., L.C.M. Linear equations, Quadratic equations, Pythagoras theorem, Trigonometry, calculus and many other chapters of Geometry.</p>
